-ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Daniel-Daz
-ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software development, data analysis, and quality assurance. I have a strong background in Physics and enjoy applying analytical skills to programming challenges.
-ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently enhancing my skills in data analysis and visualization, focusing on Python libraries like Pandas, Matplotlib, and tools like Tableau, while also exploring automation in data workflows. Additionally, Iâ€™m learning software testing, concentrating on tools like unittest and Selenium to strengthen my expertise in quality assurance.
-ðŸ’» Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on projects involving data analysis, creating impactful visualizations, and software testing (manual and automation), ensuring robust and data-driven solutions.
-ðŸ“« How to reach me: You can contact me via GitHub
-âš¡ Fun fact: I developed a Java-based plug-in for ImageJ during my time as a working student, which sparked my interest in software development and testing!
